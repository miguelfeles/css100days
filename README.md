Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 100 Days CSS Challenge! ðŸŽ¨ In this repository, you'll find a collection of CSS designs that I've created as part of the challenge. Over the course of 100 days, I've dedicated myself to crafting unique and creative designs using only CSS. From simple animations to complex layouts, each day presents a new opportunity to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with CSS. Whether you're a beginner looking for inspiration or a seasoned developer interested in exploring innovative CSS techniques, I invite you to join me on this journey. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even embark on your own 100 Days CSS Challenge! Together, let's celebrate the artistry and versatility of CSS. Happy coding! ðŸš€ #100DaysCSSChallenge
